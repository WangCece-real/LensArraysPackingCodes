# LensArraysPackingCodes
This repository contains matlab codes which perform camera array packing on spherical surfaces. 
The method for generating the circle distributions here is based on a distorted icosahedral geodesic.

Codes are included to pack a fraction of the whole sphere with circle arrays.
